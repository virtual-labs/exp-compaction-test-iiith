Procedure for the experiment is as follows.

i. Take about 20 kg of soil and sieve it through 20 mm and 4.75 mm.
ii. A 100 mm diameter Proctor mould is to be used if the soil fraction that passes 4.75 mm sieve is greater than 80% by weight.
iii. Take about 2.25 kg of the soil sample and add water to get the moisture content round 8%. Leave the mix to mature for few minutes.
iv. Clean and grease gently the inside surface of the mould, and the base plate.
v. Take the weight of empty mould with the base plate.
vi. Fir the collar and place the mould on a solid base.
vii. Place first batch of soil inside the mould and apply 25 blows of Standard rammer, so that the compacted layer thickness is about one-third height of the mould Scratch the top of the compacted soil before the second layer is placed Place the second batch of wet soil and follow the same procedure In all the soil is compacted in three layers, each given 25 blows of the standard rammer weighing 2.6 Kg and having a drop of 310 mm.
viii. Remove the collar, and trim of the excess soil with trimming knife. Clean the mould, and weight the mould with the compacted soil and the base plate.
ix. Take a representative sample from the mould and determine its water content.
x. Repeat the above procedure for water content values of 13%, 17%, 20%, 22% and 25%.
